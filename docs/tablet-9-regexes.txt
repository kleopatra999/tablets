% Perl 6 Tablet 9 - Regexes

> "We put the 'Regular' back into 'Expression'." â€” Larry Wall

Similar to [quotes](tablet-2-basic-syntax#quoting),
Regular Expressions are now a sublanguage, a language inside the language
([*slang*](appendix-g-glossary#slang) ),
instead of just being funny strings.
They are parsed by a completely different set of rules,
which are stored in the special variable \$\~Regex (\$\~Trans for
transliterations and \$\~P5Regex for compatible Regexes). However, these
rules are much more consistant with the main language than
before.

Literal Character
=================

Every alphanumeric character has no special meaning and matches the
character itself. If a backslash (\\) is placed directly in front
of the character it becomes a metacharacter. For non-alphanumeric
chars the opposite is true. That is, a backslashed character always
has a special meaning or is invalid. Inside of
[quotes](tablet-2-basic-syntax#quoting) every char is literal.
