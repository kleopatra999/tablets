% Perl 6 Tablet 4 - Operators

> Perl folklore: Perl is an operator based language.

Perl 6 has a huge amount of operators, because they support 2 of the
main design goals: they offer **dense** and **readable** code. 2 + 3
is certainly shorter and easier to understand then add(2,3), since
[pictograms](tablet-1-language-design.html.html#visual-metaphor)
can be picked up faster than words. (Fortran made its whole career on that).
But because they are so many, they had to be sorted by a rule named
[huffman coding](tablet-1-language-design.html.html#huffman-coding),
which was applied here more than in any other part of the syntax.

To understand an operator you have to know its **arity** (how many
parameters it takes - usually one (!) or two (+) ).

The [precedence](appendix-b-grouped.html#table-of-precedence) tells
which operator to prefer in case of conflict, when no braces are used
(round braces are only used for grouping and managing precedence). It
allows 2 + 3 * 5 to return 17, not 25, which would upset your math
teacher.

Behind that link is a table which also tells you also the
[associativity](appendix-b-grouped#operator-associativity) of
every operator. This tells you after which rule to resolve precedence
if one operator is used several times like in 2 * 3 * 7.



Comparison
==========



Smartmatch
----------

This is the most mighty (much more mighty than its backported Perl 5
twin) of all Perl 6 operators. It can be called the
"compare-this-with-that-operator". If the left side of that infix op
matches somehow the content of the right side, it returns Bool::True,
otherwise Bool::False. The negated form !~~ naturally works the other
way around. The exact comparison operation depends on the [data
types](tablet-3-variables.html#data-types) of the values on both sides.
Just look into that [large table](appendix-b-grouped.html#smartmatch)
to check your specific case.

Smartmatching was originally invented to make [matching with
regex](tablet-9-regexes.html#matching) semantically sane.

    ~~ !~~



Equality
--------

    eqv eq == ===
    != !==



Traversing Sequence
-------------------

    ++ -- succ pred

[sequence generation](#sequence-operator)



Generic Comparison
------------------

    before after cmp



Numerical Comparison
--------------------

    < == > <=> <= >=



String Comparison
-----------------

    lt eq gt leg le ge



Joined Comparison
-----------------

    3 < $a == $a < 7

is not the same as

    3 < $a < 7

because latter is evaled at once and the first in 2 steps (left to
right).



Junctions
---------

    | & ^ !
    any all one none



Ranges
------

    .. ^



Logical Selection
-----------------

    && - and
    || - or
    // - orelse
    ^^ - xor

see also [numerical selection](#numerical-selection)



Ternary
-------

    ?? !!



Flipflop
--------

    ff fff



file test
---------

Are now ordinary methods of the IO type.

Context Forcing Scalar Ops
==========================


Bool Context
------------

    ? !
    ?& ?| ?^



Numeric Context
---------------

    + - * ** / % %%
    +& +| +^ +< +>
    mod exp sqrt sin cos tan log log10



### Numerical Selection ###

    min max minmax



String Context
--------------

    ~ x
    ~& ~| ~^ ~< ~>



List Ops
====================


List Generation
---------------

The simplest way to create a list is by repeating some values:

    'munch' xx 3 # results in 'munch', 'munch', 'munch'
    ('hallo', 'echo') xx 2 --> 'hallo', 'echo', 'hallo', 'echo'

### Range Operator ###

In list context the range operator produces lists:

    @ 2 .. 7 --> 2,3,4,5,6,7


### Sequence Operator ###

    ...

Combinators

Hyperops
--------

    <<== ==>>
