% Perl 6 Tablet 8 - Objects

> "In order to understand how object orientation works in Perl, we
> first need to agree what object orientation actually is. And that's
> surprisingly hard to do. Object-oriented programming has been around

> theories, and even ideologies have been formulated on the
> subject. Each has purported to definitively characterize object
> orientation. Most are mutually inconsistent. No two are exactly
> alike." â€” Damian Conway
